## WELCOME TO BRAINTEASER

I developed this site mainly due to my personal connection with mental health issues.  

- Brainteaser is created to spread awareness about mental health diagnosises aswell as help people with their diagnosises.
- Subscribe to the monthly newsletter for news and updates about your diagnosis.
- Clean design with easy navigation tools.
- Brainteaser is both good looking and informative.

## UX

### Colour Scheme

- `#FFFFFF` used for primary headers and text in darker containers.
- `#e98784` used for text boxes with dark containers for high visibility and style.
- `#231F20` used for containers and headers in brighter containers.
- `#847365` used for backgrounds mainly.
- `#c6b6a9` used for main background.  
  I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/c6b6a9-e98784-ffffff-231f20-847365) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

For Brainteaser I used Google Fonts as it is easy to use and accessible.

Here are the links to the fonts and icons I've used:

- [League Spartan](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/League+Spartan) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Barlow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Wireframes

I used Canva to design the wireframes for the website.

## Features

### Existing Features

- **Hoverable header**

- Header that changes the color from black to pink when hovered over using :hover CSS.
- On every page you can use it to get back to the homepage.

- **Responsive navigation and hero**
- Navigation and hero section with four circles and a image of a brain.
- The layout changes when you resize it to tablet/mobile viewports. (Try it!)
- The circles have a hover function which makes the white text pink when hovering over it.
- Instead of having the traditional navigation at the top of the page I found this to be more eye catching for the user. (only on the home page)
- By pressing the about us button you will be forwarded down to our about us section on the bottom of the index page.

- **About Us Section**

- The about us section on the bottom of the homepage is made of a black circle with three other circles around it which makes it look like a solar system.
- The about us section is made to convey the goal of the team and why it was created.

![About Us](documentation/images/about-us.png)

- **Sign Up Page**

- The Sign up page is made for signing up to the monthly newsletter on the webpage where the user recieves updates about their diagnosis.
- When Sign Up is pressed it will redirect you to a thank you page if you wait 10 seconds it will redirect you back to the homepage again.
