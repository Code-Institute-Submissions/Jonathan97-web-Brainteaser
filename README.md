# BRAINTEASER

## WELCOME TO BRAINTEASER

### This site is developed with the intention to spread awareness about mental health.

In this section, you will include a few paragraphs providing an overview of your project.
Essentially, this part is your "sales pitch".

At this stage, you should have a name for your project so use it!
Don't introduce the project as a "portfolio project" for the diploma.

In this section, describe what the project hopes to accomplish, who it is intended to target, and how it will be useful to the target audience.

Screenshots for the README and testing should not be inside of `assets/` or `static/` image folders.
(reminder: `assets/` and `static/` are for files used on the live site, not documentation)
Consider adding a new folder called `documentation`, and add the amiresponsive screenshot inside of that folder.
To add the image into your README, use this format:
(assuming you have a new folder called `documentation` with an image called "mockup.png")

## UX

I have used a combination of grid and flex to get some of the elements where I needed them.

### Colour Scheme

- `#FFFFFF` used for primary headers and text in darker containers.
- `#e98784` used for text boxes with dark containers for high visibility and style.
- `#231F20` used for containers and headers in brighter containers.
- `#847365` used for backgrounds mainly.
- `#c6b6a9` used for main background mainly.  
  I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/c6b6a9-e98784-ffffff-231f20-847365) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

For Brainteaser I used Google Fonts as it is easy to use.

Example:

- [League Spartan](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/League+Spartan) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Barlow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Wireframes

I used Canva to design the wireframes for the website.   
[Canva website](https://www.canva.com/ 'Canva') 

### Unfortunately I didn't have enough time to recreate the website exactly as the wireframes

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project,
and describe each in a sentence or so.

You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user,
focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve,
and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

IMPORTANT: Remember to always include a screenshot of each individual feature!

### Existing Features

- **Hoverable header**

    - Header that changes the color from black to brighter pink when hovered over using :hover CSS.

![screenshot](documentation/images/header1.PNG)
![screenshot](documentation/images/header2.PNG)

- **Feature #2**

    - Details about this particular feature, including the value to the site, and benefit for the user. Be as detailed as possible!

![screenshot](documentation/feature02.png)

- **Feature #3**

    - Details about this particular feature, including the value to the site, and benefit for the user. Be as detailed as possible!

Repeat as necessary for as many features as your site contains.

Hint: the more, the merrier!

### Future Features

- Hamburger menu for nav.
    - A fully interactive handburger menu, unfortunately this requires JavaScript.
- Contact page
    - Full contact page for users to interact with our team. (COMING SOON)

## Credits

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media, and extra help from.
It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials,
however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.
