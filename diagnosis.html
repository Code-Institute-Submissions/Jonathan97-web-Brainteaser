                    <p class="diagnosis-text">People with ASD mostly struggle with social communication and interaction in private as well as professional situations. Restricted or repetitive behaviors or interests are also signs of ASD. Having this condition you may have noticed that you learn, move, or pay attention in different ways than most people do.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If you have a sibling with ASD, or a certain genetic or chromosomal condition (fragile X syndrome or tuberous sclerosis), if your mother had complications at birth or if you were born to older parents there is a chance for you to have ASD.</p>

                    <p class="diagnosis-text">There are two types of ADHD. The innatentive type is easily distracted, forgetful, and has troubles holding attention. The hyperactive and impulsive type often fidgets, has trouble staying still for a longer period of time and often talks excessively. Of course there are combinations and subtypes of both.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To be diagnosed several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms had to be present before the age of 12 years and several symptoms are present in two or more settings, (such as at home, school ,with friends; or in other activities).</p>

                    <p class="diagnosis-text">Anxiety often shows in having many and/or extreme fears and worries that interfere with school, home, or play activities. There are different types of anxiety disorders; separation anxiety, phobias, social anxiety, general anxiety, and panic disorders.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Anxiety mostly shows through being easily irritable and angry when fear is present. Symptoms also can include trouble sleeping, as well as physical symptoms like fatigue, headaches, or stomachaches. Symptoms can be easily missed since many persons keep their fears to themselves.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Anxiety is often also connected to depression.</p>

                    <p class="diagnosis-text">Feeling persistently sadness and hoplessness is a sign of depression. People with this condition often feel sad or uninterested in things that they used to enjoy. They often also feel helpless or hopeless in situations they are able to change. They can also be more easily irritaded than other persons and feel worthless, useless, or guilty.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Changes in sleep, eat and activity patterns as well as having a hard time paying attention can also be a sign of depression. Self-injury and self-destructive behavior and in more extreme cases suicidal thoughts are an afteraffect of the condition.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        People that have depression are often wrongly labeled as sad, trouble-maker and lazy.</p>

                    <h2 class="diagnosis-header">PTSD

                    <p class="diagnosis-text">PTSD is caused by one or several traumatic events in a life of a person. These events could be:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        -    Physical, sexual, or emotional maltreatment
                        <br>
                        -    Being a victim or witness to violence or crime 
                        <br>
                        -    Serious illness or death of a close family member or friend
                        <br>
                        -    Natural or manmade disasters
                        <br>
                        -    Severe car accidents
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Persons that have PTSD experience often a lack of positive emotions, nightmares and sleep prob-lems, intense ongoing fear or sadness and an irritability and angry outbursts. They could act helpless, hopeless or withdrawn and become upset when something causes memories of the traumatic event.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Having PTSD you could find yourself constantly looking for possible threats, being easily startled, avoiding places or people associated with the traumatic event, reliving the event over and over in thought or in play or denying that the event happened or feeling numb.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Symptoms of PTSD can be confused with ADHD.</p>

                    <p class="diagnosis-text">Healthcare providers use the guidelines in the American Psychiatric
                        Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth edition (DSM-5), to help diagnose ADHD.
                        This diagnostic standard helps ensure that people are appropriately diagnosed and treated for
                        ADHD.
                        Using the same standard across communities can also help determine how many children have ADHD,
                        and how public health is impacted by this condition.</p>
